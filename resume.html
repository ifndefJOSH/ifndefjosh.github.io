					I'm a proficient software developer who mostly writes in C++ and Python, but am familiar with many languages and frameworks. This page is my de-facto "resume". My personal information is not available on this website, however. If I've applied to a job at your organization, you will have my contact info with the application, otherwise, you can use the contact form on <a href="https://ifndefjosh.github.io">my GitHub.io page</a>.

				I've only included programming projects here, as I'm a professional software developer; if you want to see my CGI projects, or my electronic music, or something else that falls more into my "hobbies" you're on the wrong website.
				<h2>STAMINA/STORM</h2>
				<span class=badge>C++</span>
				<span class=badge>CMake</span>
				<span class=badge>Qt</span>
				<span class=badge>Python</span>
				<p>
					STAMINA/STORM is a complete rebasing of STAMINA, the STochastic Approximate Model-checker for INfinite-state Analysis. I spent quite some time rebasing STAMINA to work with the Storm Model Checker, rewriting the entirety of STAMINA/STORM's C++ codebase I was initially given. I also spent some time writing a Python/PyQt5 GUI for it, but decided that STAMINA deserved a more powerful interface, so I am in process of writing a far more capable interface with C++, complete with a PRISM model file editor that includes syntax highlighting!

				<h2>STAMINA'S WEBSITE</h2>
				<span class=badge>HTML</span>
				<span class=badge>CSS</span>
				<span class=badge>JavaScript</span>
				<p>
					In addition to rebasing STAMINA to work with Storm, I also wrote a website for STAMINA. Go poke around on it, it's pretty cool! Like basically every website I do, I didn't use a template, and wrote it all myself with little more than a text editor and web browser. I even included a client-side search script, that loads up an index of the website and searches for text in the main content or title of a page.

				<h2>NODESYNTH (UNFINISHED)</h2>
				<span class=badge>C++</span>
				<span class=badge>CMake</span>
				<span class=badge>Qt</span>
				<p>
					Nodesynth was my senior project, but I was unfortunately never able to get it to work. I was building it to work similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_software">compositing software</a>, but for sound. You would have many building blocks (oscillators, filters, modulators, etc.) which you could declare as "nodes" on the canvas and connect in any way imaginable. Best of all, as a LV2 and VST plugin, it would be able to process audio in <i>realtime</i>.

				<h2>GUI for LaTeX to MathML</h2>
				<span class=badge>Python</span>
				<span class=badge>Qt</span>
				<span class=badge>LaTeX</span>
				<p>
					When I worked for the Aggie Math Learning Center, they wanted us to write some math tutorials for their website. However, we couldn't write math equations in LaTeX, since it was for a website. I found a Python library for LaTeX to MathML conversion, but most of my coworkers at the time weren't programmers, so I wrote a GUI in Python and PyQt5 that could both construct a LaTeX equation, and then make a call to that library to change them into MathML.
